## What I'm reading

The last book I read was [*Giovanni's Room* by James Baldwin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38462.Giovanni_s_Room). This is the first book I've read by James Baldwin. He's a beautiful writer and I'm excited to read more, like [*If Beale Street Could Talk*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38463.If_Beale_Street_Could_Talk).
